# Project Title: Machine Learning Datasets and Notebooks

## Description
This repository contains various machine learning projects along with their corresponding datasets. Each project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and focuses on different aspects of machine learning, including regression, classification, and image processing.

## Projects Included
1. **House Price Prediction**
   - **File**: `ML_Task1(House_Price_Prediction).ipynb`
   - **Description**: A regression model that predicts house prices based on various features.

2. **Email Classification**
   - **File**: `ML_Task2(Email_Classifier).ipynb`
   - **Description**: A classification model that classifies emails into different categories.

3. **Customer Churn Prediction**
   - **File**: `ML_Task3_(Customer_Churn_Prediction).ipynb`
   - **Description**: A classification model that predicts whether a customer will churn based on their behavior.

4. **Image Classification**
   - **File**: `ML_Task4(Image_Classification).ipynb`
   - **Description**: A model that classifies images into different categories using convolutional neural networks.

5. **Image Processing**
   - **File**: `ML_Task5(Image_Processing).ipynb`
   - **Description**: Techniques for processing and enhancing images.

## Datasets Included
- **Customer-Churn-Records.csv**: Dataset containing records of customer churn data.
- **email_classification.csv**: Dataset for email classification tasks.
- **housing.csv**: Dataset for house price prediction tasks.
